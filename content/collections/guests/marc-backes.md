  I'm a DevRel Lead at WeAreDevelopers where I am the link between the company and developers. I make sure that all our engagement and events with the community is well thought-out. 

  I am also a full-stack web developer, enthusiastic about Vue, Nuxt, Node - but I am interested in all kinds of technology.
